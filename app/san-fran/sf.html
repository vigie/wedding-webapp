            </p>
            <p>Forbes Island is floating just off-shore, next to Pier 39. Getting there is easy - walk to "I" dock half way down the west side of Pier 39. From there, the "Titanic" will be shuttling guests to and from the island, starting just before 6pm. That journey takes just one or two minutes.</p>
            <p>That's right, we did say "floating" - expect a little bit of movement on the island - nothing dramatic, but enough for anyone sensitive to feel.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
            Take a taxi or Uber straight to your hotel (~$50), or take the <a href="http://www.bart.gov/guide/airport/inbound_sfo">BART</a> to downtown SF first and then taxi from there.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
            We recommend downloading both the <a href="http://flywheel.com/">Flywheel</a> (taxis) and <a href="https://www.uber.com/ride/">Uber</a> apps to your phone to make getting around a breeze once in the city.

            <h5>Things to See</h5>
            <p>
                We think San Francisco is a beautiful city, so if you have some time to kill
